[h4 Boost-1.52]
* Corrected moments for small degrees of freedom [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7177 #7177] (reported by Thomas Mang).
* Added [link math_toolkit.special.airy Airy functions] and [link math_toolkit.special.jacobi Jacobi Elliptic functions].
* Corrected failure to detect bad parameters in many distributions
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6934 #6934] (reported by Florian Schoppmann)
by adding a function check_out_of_range to test many possible bad parameters.
This test revealed several distributions where the checks for bad parameters were ineffective,
and these have been rectified.
* Fixed issue in Hankel functions that causes incorrect values to be returned for ['x < 0] and [nu] odd, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7135 #7135].
* Fixed issues [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6517 #6517], [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6362 #6362],
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7053 #7053], [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/2693 #2693],
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6937 #6937], [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7099 #7099].

* Permitted infinite degrees of freedom [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7259 #7259]
implemented using the normal distribution (requested by Thomas Mang).
* Much enhanced accuracy for large degrees of freedom [nu] and/or large non-centrality [delta]
by switching to use the Students t distribution
(or Normal distribution for infinite degrees of freedom)
 centered at delta,
when [delta] / (4 * [nu])  < epsilon for the floating-point type in use.
[@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7259 #7259].
It was found that the incomplete beta was suffering from serious cancellation errors
when degrees of freedom was very large. (That has now been fixed in our code,
but any code based on Didonato and Morris's original papers
(probably every implementation out there actually) will have the same issue).

[h4 Boost-1.51]
See Boost-1.52 - some items were added but not listed in time for the release.

[h4 Boost-1.50]

* Promoted math constants to be 1st class citizens,
including convenient access to the most widely used
built-in float, double, long double via three namespaces.
* Added the Owen's T function and Skew Normal distribution written by Benjamin Sobotta: see __owens_t and skew_normal_distrib.
* Added Hankel functions __cyl_hankel_1, __cyl_hankel_2, __sph_hankel_1 and __sph_hankel_2.
* Corrected issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6627 #6627 nonfinite_num_put formatting of 0.0 is incorrect]
based on a patch submitted by K R Walker.
* Changed constant initialization mechanism so that it is thread safe even for user-defined types, also
so that user defined types get the full precision of the constant, even when `long double` does not.
So for example 128-bit rational approximations will work with UDT's and do the right thing, even though
`long double` may be only 64 or 80 bits.
* Fixed issue in `bessel_jy` which causes Y[sub 8.5](4[pi]) to yield a NaN.

[h4 Boost-1.49]

* Deprecated wrongly named `twothirds` math constant in favour of `two_thirds` (with underscore separator).
(issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6199 #6199]).
* Refactored test data and some special function code to improve support for arbitary precision and/or expression-template-enabled types.
* Added new faster zeta function evaluation method.

Fixed issues:

* Corrected CDF complement for Laplace distribution (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6151 #6151]).
* Corrected branch cuts on the complex inverse trig functions, to handle signed zeros (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6171 #6171]).
* Fixed bug in `bessel_yn` which caused incorrect overflow errors to be raised for negative ['n] (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6367 #6367]).
* Also fixed minor/cosmetic/configuration issues [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6120 #6120], [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6191 #6191],
  [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5982 #5982], [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6130 #6130],

* Added new series evaluation methods to the cyclic Bessel I, J, K and Y functions.
Also taken great care to avoid spurious over and underflow of these functions.

provided by Thomas Mang.

* Enabled long double support on OpenBSD (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6014 #6014]).

* Changed nextafter and related functions to behave in the same way as other implementations - so that nextafter(+INF, 0)
is a finite value (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5823 #5832]).

* Changed tuple include configuration to fix issue when using in conjunction with Boost.Tr1 (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5934 #5934]).

* Changed class eps_tolerance to behave correctly when both ends of the range are zero (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6001 #6001]).

* Fixed missing include guards on prime.hpp (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5927 #5927]).

* Removed unused/undocumented constants from constants.hpp (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5982 #5982]).

* Fixed missing std:: prefix in nonfinite_num_facets.hpp (issue [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5914 #5914]).

* Minor patches for Cray compiler compatibility.

behaviour can be customised using __Policy's.

occurs to boost::math::evaluation_error.

faster than before.
